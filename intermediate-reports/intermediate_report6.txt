Intermediate Report 5â€“ Progress so far

So far we have been able to achieve Data Cleaning and Feature Extraction. 
We are working more on Data Cleaning like stemming, lemmatization and also the next steps that include:



"WHAT TO BE DONE"
1. Text classification - We have not been able to complete the implementation yet as there are a lot of frameworks that support text classification.
2. Research so far is being done on SVM and Naive Bayes.

3. Cross-Validation - Were we will check for the performance of the implemented framework.



Open questions :-

1. How do we decide on which framework to use for text classification? Can we also use Deep Learning frameworks for that purpose? 

2. How do we manually classify texts ?

3. When is the final submission expected ?

4. Do you recommend using 'Latent Dirichlet Allocation' for Topic modelling ?
