Concerns

Having read about RST and surfing the internet, it appears we have limited information on its implementation. It has been theory so far and we are still unsure on how to really execute this.
Therefore it is really slowing us down and has become a bottleneck. As such, we will be very happy if you will allow us to be flexible with our topic area so that we can explore other techniques. This is why we need the meeting to share our concerns and listen to feedback.
