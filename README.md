# Text Analysis for Scientific Publications

This project contains two approaches to identify topics from a corpora of text documents. The two approaches are text classification which is a supervised approach and topic modelling which is unsupervised.

The corpus used for this purpose is the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus that can be downloaded [here](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~lahiri/acl_arc.html):

In order to gain a better understanding of both topics, please take a look at [Alice Zhao's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BVebXXb2o4) videos, where each concept has been explained very well.

## Installation

In order to run the project, install python 3.7 or the versions above. We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or any other environment in order to setup the project.
Required libraries can be found in requirements.txt under respective approaches.
